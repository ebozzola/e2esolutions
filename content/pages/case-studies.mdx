      - title: Global Manufacturing Company
        problem: >
          A global manufacturer was facing significant supply chain disruptions
          due to geopolitical tensions and international freight bottlenecks,
          resulting in production delays and increased costs.
        solution: >
          We implemented a strategic sourcing program that diversified their
          supplier base across multiple regions, developed alternative logistics
          routes, and established buffer inventory for critical components.
        results: >
          30% reduction in supply chain disruptions, 25% decrease in freight
          costs, and improved on-time delivery performance from 78% to 95%.

      - title: Retail Distribution Network
        problem: >
          A growing retail chain was struggling with inefficient distribution
          operations, high logistics costs, and poor inventory management
          leading to stockouts and excess inventory.
        solution: >
          We redesigned their distribution network, optimized warehouse layouts,
          implemented demand forecasting tools, and developed a new inventory
          classification system with appropriate stocking policies.
        results: >
          40% reduction in distribution costs, 35% decrease in inventory holding
          costs, and improved product availability from 85% to 98%.

      - title: Pharmaceutical Supply Chain
        problem: >
          A pharmaceutical company needed to ensure temperature-controlled
          distribution of sensitive products while managing complex regulatory
          requirements and reducing costs.
        solution: >
          We developed an end-to-end visibility solution with IoT temperature
          monitoring, redesigned their cold chain logistics, and implemented
          risk management protocols for regulatory compliance.
        results: >
          Zero temperature excursions in transit, 100% regulatory compliance,
