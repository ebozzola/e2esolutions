          Global Automotive Company - AI implementation in order-to-delivery
          process
        problem: >
          A global manufacturer was facing significant supply chain disruptions
          due to geopolitical tensions and international freight bottlenecks,
          resulting in production delays and increased costs. It also had excess
          stock tied up in unproductive buffers.
        solution: >
          We implemented an AI program able to track the Order-to-Delivery
          process, gathering intelligence on where the main bottlenecks or
          variables were, and expediting the feedback loop in order to allow
          Management to take timely countermeasures.
        results: |
          improved on-time delivery
          minimized disruptions to the manufacturing process
          reduced stock holding

      - title: Retail Distribution Network
        problem: >
          A growing retail chain was struggling with inefficient distribution
          operations, high logistics costs, and poor inventory management
          leading to stockouts and excess inventory.
        solution: >
          We redesigned their distribution network, optimized warehouse layouts,
          implemented demand forecasting tools, and developed a new inventory
          classification system with appropriate stocking policies.
        results: >
          40% reduction in distribution costs, 35% decrease in inventory holding
          costs, and improved product availability from 85% to 98%.

      - title: Pharmaceutical Supply Chain
        problem: >
          A pharmaceutical company needed to ensure temperature-controlled
          distribution of sensitive products while managing complex regulatory
          requirements and reducing costs.
        solution: >
          We developed an end-to-end visibility solution with IoT temperature
          monitoring, redesigned their cold chain logistics, and implemented
          risk management protocols for regulatory compliance.
        results: >
          Zero temperature excursions in transit, 100% regulatory compliance,
          and 20% reduction in cold chain logistics costs.
