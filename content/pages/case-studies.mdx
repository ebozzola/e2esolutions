          Global Automotive Company - AI implementation in order-to-delivery
          process
        problem: >
          A global manufacturer was facing significant supply chain disruptions
          due to geopolitical tensions and international freight bottlenecks,
          resulting in production delays and increased costs. It also had excess
          stock tied up in unproductive buffers.
        solution: >
          We implemented an AI program able to track the Order-to-Delivery
          process, gathering intelligence on where the main bottlenecks or
          variables were, and expediting the feedback loop in order to allow
          Management to take timely countermeasures.
        results: |
          improved on-time delivery
          minimized disruptions to the manufacturing process
          reduced stock holding
        industry: Manufacturing
      - title: Australian food importer - Warehouse relocation
        problem: >
          A growing retail chain was struggling with an overpriced distribution
          partner that affected its competitiveness on the market.
        solution: >
          We mapped the customer's operational requirements and designed the
          optimal footprint for their operations (site location and layout
          including inbound, storage and outbound areas); we simulated two
          scenarios (in-house or 3PL) and recommended cost and benefits
          analysis.
        results: Est. 20% reduction in operational costs.
        industry: Retail
      - title: Automotive aftermarket parts
        problem: >-
          Post COVID, an automotive aftermarket distributor realized that their
          supply chain was overly exposed to one particular Country of Origin
          and wanted to diversify its sources to reduce its exposure to
          logistics bottlenecks, currency fluctuations and geopolitical
          instability.
        solution: >-
          We leveraged our network of qualified suppliers to provide the client
          with a range of products that could be re-sourced, and assisted with
          product validation and homologation for the Australian market.
        results: >
          The client was able to reduce its exposure and is now able to
          multi-source its products from a broader variety of reliable sources.

          It has also gained first-hand access to some cost-effective vendors
          that were previously not present in ANZ, gaining a competitive
          advantage.
